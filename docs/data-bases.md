## NeuroImaging

### MRI/fMRI

#### ABIDE

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) datasets from 539 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 573 typical controls. This initiative involved 16 international sites, sharing 20 samples yielding 1112 datasets composed of both MRI data and an extensive array of phenotypic information common across nearly all sites. This effort is expected to facilitate discovery science and comparisons across samples. All datasets are anonymous, with no protected health information included.

#### ADNI
Database of the results of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. ADNI is an initiative to develop biomarker-based methods to detect and track the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that provides access to qualified scientists to their database of imaging, clinical, genomic, and biomarker data.
