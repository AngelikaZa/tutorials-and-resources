# Processing

Processing has several stages, and can vary depending on which image modality (or type of data in general) you want to use.

If you are interested in processing a specific type of data, you can refer to the links below.

## Single-modality Processing
### MRI
#### structural
* T1w
* T2w
* DTI
* Laminar and high-resolution MRI

#### functional MRI
* resting state fMRI
* task-related fMRI
### EEG
### MEG

## Multi-modal Processing
Some processing pipelines require multiple types of data. Pipelines requiring multimodal data can be found [here].

### Meta analysis

### Modeling / Computational neuroscience
