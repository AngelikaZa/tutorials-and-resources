# Diffusion Microstructure Imaging in Python (Dmipy)
The Dmipy software project is dedicated to fasciliting high-level, reproducible diffusion microstructure research.
* The [Dmipy open-source repository](https://github.com/AthenaEPI/dmipy) with many examples on implementing and fitting microstructure models.
* Our Preliminary [Reference Paper](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01873353/file/dmipy-diffusion-microstructure.pdf)

[NiMARE](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE) is a Python library for coordinate- and image-based meta-analysis. Chris Gorgolewski wrote a [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/chrisfilo/coordinate-and-image-metaanalysis-with-nimare) on how to use it.

For coordinate based meta-analysis:
* [brainmap](http://www.brainmap.org/) with [Sleuth](http://www.brainmap.org/software.html#Sleuth) and [GingerALE](http://www.brainmap.org/software.html#GingerALE)

For image based meta-analysis:
* [IBMA](https://github.com/NeuroimagingMetaAnalysis/ibma) is the Image-Based Meta-Analysis toolbox for SPM.
